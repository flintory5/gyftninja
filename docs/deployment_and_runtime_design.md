# Deployment and Runtime Design

This document outlines the deployment and runtime strategy for the Gyft Ninja web application.

## 1. Overview

The application is a Next.js web application. The deployment strategy leverages Vercel for hosting and CI/CD automation, with GitHub Actions providing additional Continuous Integration checks.

## 2. Environments

Two primary environments are defined: Production and Test/Preview.

### 2.1. Production Environment

*   **Hosting Platform:** Vercel
    *   **Reasoning:** Optimal for Next.js, handles deployments automatically from a Git repository, provides global CDN, serverless functions, and HTTPS by default.
*   **Deployment Trigger:** Merging changes to the `main` Git branch.
*   **Infrastructure:** Managed by Vercel (web servers, serverless functions, CDN).
*   **Database:** (If needed in the future) Vercel Postgres or other compatible cloud-based database services.
*   **Monitoring & Logging:** Vercel built-in analytics and logs. Can be extended with third-party services.
*   **Environment Variables:** Managed via Vercel project settings, scoped to the Production environment.

### 2.2. Test/Preview Environment

*   **Hosting Platform:** Vercel (Preview Deployments)
    *   **Reasoning:** Ensures consistency with production.
*   **Deployment Trigger:** Pushing commits to any non-production Git branch (typically feature branches or pull requests).
*   **URL:** Each preview deployment receives a unique, shareable URL (e.g., `projectname-git-branchname-org.vercel.app`).
*   **Data Management:** If a database is used, a separate test database instance or isolated schemas should be configured. **Production data must not be used for testing.**
*   **Purpose:** Used for User Acceptance Testing (UAT), end-to-end testing, and integration testing before merging to production.
*   **Environment Variables:** Managed via Vercel project settings, scoped to Preview environments. Can differ from production (e.g., using test API keys).

## 3. CI/CD Pipeline

*   **Continuous Integration (CI):** GitHub Actions
    *   **Triggers:** On push to any branch, or pull request creation/update targeting `main`.
    *   **Jobs:**
        *   Lint code (`npm run lint`).
        *   Run unit and integration tests (`npm run test`).
        *   (Optional) Run mutation tests (`npm run test:mutation`).
    *   **Outcome:** CI failures block PR merging, enforced by GitHub branch protection rules.
*   **Continuous Deployment (CD):** Vercel
    *   **Production Deployment:** Automatically triggered on merge/push to the `main` branch. Vercel handles build, deployment, and making the new version live.
    *   **Preview Deployment:** Automatically triggered on push to any other branch. Vercel handles build and deployment to a unique preview URL.
*   **Workflow:**
    1. Developer pushes feature branch.
    2. Vercel deploys to a preview URL.
    3. Developer creates a PR to `main`.
    4. GitHub Actions runs CI checks (lint, tests).
    5. If CI passes, PR is reviewed and tested using the preview URL.
    6. PR is merged to `main`.
    7. Vercel deploys to production.

## 4. Configuration Management

*   Environment-specific configurations (API keys, feature flags, database URLs) are managed as environment variables within Vercel project settings.
*   Different sets of variables can be defined for Production, Preview, and Development environments.

## 5. Future Considerations

*   **Database:** If a database is integrated, detailed data migration and seeding strategies for different environments will be needed.
*   **Advanced Monitoring:** For enhanced observability, tools like Sentry (error tracking) or Datadog (full-stack monitoring) can be integrated.
*   **Automated End-to-End Testing:** Implementing a framework like Cypress or Playwright within the CI pipeline to run E2E tests against preview deployments.
